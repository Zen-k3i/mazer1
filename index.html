                    <strong>Dear My one and only Mazer.</strong>
                    <br>Love to call you Mazer then siv hour lah xD. It seems like it really was short since I got to know you, ahh, but it happened so fast, now we are apart TOT. This web was created to say farewell only. Just like this life, we met and then we parted. Thank you for always being one of my creatures who laughed with me until we got all of our smile lines, even though we just met. Thank you for your presence, not just to me but to everyone else. You are so kind, cute, joyful, smart, your laugh, and everything, all of them about you. Thank you for being who you are; it really is beautiful. But as humans, we can't appear to be like this every time. Here is my selfish request: for the times when you feel lost in eight directions, I want you to love yourself and embrace yourself. When you feel tired, just relax and take a deep breath. Even if it takes you a while to do nothing but breathe, it's fine as long as youâ€™re okay. Please remember, Siv Hour deserves the best. I'll wait for you to take me to America kidding xD.
                    Be safe everywhere you go, keep yourself warm, healthy, and happy, and take care of yourself.
                    I might update something anytime on this website, or if you want to update it too, you can. xD<br>
